# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files:

- `icon-16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon-48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon-128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Creating Icons

You can create these icons using any image editing tool. The recommended design is:
- A shield icon with a gradient from blue (#2563eb) to purple (#7c3aed)
- A lock or padlock symbol in the center
- Clean, modern, flat design style

## Temporary Placeholder

Until you create proper icons, you can use any PNG files with the correct dimensions, or generate them using online tools like:
- Canva
- Figma
- Adobe Illustrator
- Online icon generators

The extension will work without icons, but they won't display properly in Chrome.
